      "value": "Instantly create step-by-step solution articles for any app and publish it directly to your Zendesk Guide. No uploads. No screenshot editing.\n\nCreating solution articles is extremely painful and time consuming. A 20 step article takes between 30 mins to 1 hour to make. Take a screenshot, edit it, upload to your zendesk guide...rinse and repeat...over and over. Precious time wasted. Worst of all it’s your most valuable employee, a power user, thats tasked with doing this.\n\nWhat if I told you iorad could speed this process -10X. That’s right. That same 30 to 60 minutes creating a solution article could be done in 3 to 6 minutes.\n\nIorad for zendesk works like this:\n\n- Click capture and go through the steps as you normally would.\n- iorad automatically captures screenshots and identifies every action.\n- Click done and iorad automagically generates the solution article and posts it to your zendesk guide.\n\nThat’s it. Give it a try and save precious time.\n\nCheckout what an iorad tutorial looks like and see how it adapts to a [learners learning style](https://medium.com/@sunpatel_92981/10-x-faster-solution-article-creation-in-zendesk-23c398b12f8e).",
