Follow the prompts to install the app. Once installed, iorad can be accessed from the main sidebar of zendesk support. Just specify the location (category/section) of the solution article and iorad does the rest.

To connect iorad directly to your zendesk guide (without having to go to your zendesk support site):
- Login to iorad
- Click Connect from the iorad menu
- Authorize “Zendesk”

You will see a zendesk tab on the finish publish screen of every tutorial where you can specify the category/section to post.
