Instantly create step-by-step solution articles for any app and publish it directly to your Zendesk Guide. No uploads. No screenshot editing.

Creating solution articles is extremely painful and time consuming. A 20 step article takes between 30 mins to 1 hour to make. Take a screenshot, edit it, upload to your zendesk guide...rinse and repeat...over and over. Precious time wasted. Worst of all it’s your most valuable employee, a power user, thats tasked with doing this.
What if I told you iorad could speed this process -10X. That’s right. That same 30 to 60 minutes creating a solution article could be done in 3 to 6 minutes.

Iorad for zendesk works like this:

   - Click capture and go through the steps as you normally would.
   - iorad automatically captures screenshots and identifies every action.
   - Click done and iorad automagically generates the solution article and posts it to your zendesk guide.

That’s it. Give it a try and save precious time.
